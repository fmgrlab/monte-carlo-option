## Overview
This work is the practical project of the course Théorie des options given by Professor Yannick Malevergne, within the Master Program **Finance de Marché et Gestion des Risques of the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne**. In this project we aim to make a brief review of the paper **"Equilibrium option pricing: A Monte Carlo approach" of A. Buchner** and make a numerical implementation of the proposed method.

Options play a crucial role in the financial markets, from being an investor's instrument of hedging and protection, to being a profitable instrument for speculation or directional trading. This way, multiple theories were developed in the tentative of finding their correct price, as known as fair-value, ranging from Louis Bachelier (1901) to the celebrity formula of Black-Scholes

## Implementation
We used the Python programming language for the numerical implementation and we built a user-friendly website for use of the novel Monte Carlo tool using the Django web framework. We structured the website in a such manner that the user can test in practice the effects in option prices generated by different number of iterations, risk aversion, and volatility (stochastic or constant). All parameters for theses cases could be changed by end-user. Here we'll explain the major part of the code. Inherited the so called mode-view-controller of Django, our program is separated in three component Model View and controller. For each option, the user have a standard interface to input different parameters and three output options to execute, rather if he wants the graph plots, Json or csv format

## Technical requirement
To setup this project, the necessaries requirement are python
  - Python 3.4 or newer https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
  - Pip 18  or newer https://pypi.org/project/pip/
  - We install manually the package mpld3 from the source to render the matplot in the html. The last release does not fit our need. http://mpld3.github.io/install.html#installing-from-git

## Deployment
To deploy  the website on a local environment:
  - Download the code from github https://github.com/fmgrlab/monte-carlo-option
  - In the root directory of the project the command  **pip install -r requirements.txt** will setup the full environment
  - To show the website, run python manage.py runserver and launch http://127.0.0.1:8000
